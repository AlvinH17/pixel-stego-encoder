# Pixel Stego Encoder

An image steganography tool built with [Processing](https://processing.org/) that hides messages within images using pixel-level encoding. This tool explores visual cryptography and color plane manipulation to encode data invisibly into an image.

## üß† Features

- Embed text-based messages into images using RGB or alpha channel manipulation
- Supports two encoding modes:  
  - **Blank mode** (starting from a white background)  
  - **Fill mode** (overlaying the message onto an existing image)
- Pixel-level control of encoding intensity via bitplane selection
- Dynamic interface to switch modes and display layers

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

1. The generator creates a base image with optional embedded text.
2. The encoder compares the original and edited image and adjusts pixel values on a specific color channel and bit plane to hide the message.
3. The resulting "hidden" image visually appears similar but encodes the message in pixel data.
